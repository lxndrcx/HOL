The fact that AScript uses badLib shouldn’t introduce a dependency on
badLib for BScript. In fact, having such a dependency causes its
otherwise working proof to fail.

Worse, interactive testing of BScript can’t induce the fault, because
there’s nothing in BScript to push the session to load badLib.
